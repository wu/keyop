# keyop

Project Under Construction!

Keyop is a simple, yet powerful framework for observing, predicting, and reacting to events. Think of it as a
lightweight and easy-to-use nerve center for your IoT projects, data pipelines, or anything else that generates
or reacts to interesting events.

Project Goals

* Deploy as a standalone instance or scale out to a distributed mesh, no fuss.
* Support for a variety of IOT sensors and data sources.
* Trigger custom notifications and reactions based on observations and predictions.
* Agents can react offline when disconnected from the network.
* Integration with Apple Homekit.
* Terminal UI - status HUD to monitor the state of the system.
* Data Privacy - you own your data, choose what you share.

Join the project to help make event-driven intelligence accessible to everyone!
